<h1> About Pilates for All </h1>

<p> The Pilates for All website provides information for current or future visitors of the Pilates for all studio. It provides some history of the practice, outlines the benefits of Pilates, and gives users the opportunity to find class information as well as contact the studio. </p>

<h2> Visual presentation </h2>

<p> The visual style of the website, colours, photo, and font alike, is intentionally minimalist, black and white, which is to echo the minimalism and clean lines that the practice of Pilates strives for. </p>

<h2> Navigation, Contact Form, Social Media </h2>
<p> The website is clearly structured into sections: one about the history of Pilates, one about the benefits of the practice of Pilates, and one about how to contact or take classes at this Pilates studio. At the bottom, there is a contact field where users can enter their information and receive feedback or information from the Pilates studio. There are also links to the Twitter, Facebook and Instagram presence of this Pilates studio. </P>
